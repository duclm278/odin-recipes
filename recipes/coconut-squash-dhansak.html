        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This quick and easy vegetarian curry is perfect for a healthy weeknight dinner - with butternut squash, coconut milk, lentils and spinach.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>500g butternut squash (about 1 small squash), peeled and chopped into bite-sized chunks (or buy a pack of ready-prepared to save time), see tip, below left</li>
            <li>100g frozen chopped onions</li>
            <li>4 heaped tbsp mild curry paste (we used korma)</li>
            <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>400g can light coconut milk</li>
            <li>mini naan bread, to serve</li>
            <li>400g can lentils, drained</li>
            <li>200g bag baby spinach</li>
            <li>150ml coconut yogurt (we used Rachel's Organic), plus extra to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan. Put the squash in a bowl with a splash of water. Cover with cling film and microwave on High for 10 mins or until tender. Meanwhile, add the onions to the hot oil and cook for a few mins until soft. Add the curry paste, tomatoes and coconut milk, and simmer for 10 mins until thickened to a rich sauce.</li>
            <li>Warm the naan breads in a low oven or in the toaster. Drain any liquid from the squash, then add to the sauce with the lentils, spinach and some seasoning. Simmer for a further 2-3 mins to wilt the spinach, then stir in the coconut yogurt. Serve with the warm naan and a dollop of extra yogurt.</li>
