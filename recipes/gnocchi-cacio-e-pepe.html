        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Enjoy a comforting bowl of gnocchi with parmesan and black pepper. It's simple but utterly delicious - and the best part is, it only takes seven minutes to make.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300g gnocchi</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>60g parmesan or vegetarian alternative, finely grated</li>
            <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>salad leaves, to serve (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the gnocchi in a large pan of lightly salted, boiling water. Drain and reserve 200ml of the cooking water.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a large frying pan. Add the gnocchi, cheese and pepper as well as 150ml of the cooking water, raise the heat a little and stir vigorously until melted and the gnocchi is well coated. Pour in more of the reserved water if you like it saucier. Season with a little salt. Transfer the gnocchi to bowls and serve with a mixed salad, if you like.</li>
